                Hello world and welcome to a taster of some of my creative and technical work. I have spent the last six years regularly creating psychedelic art on paper 
                and digitally, often combining elements af art, design, photophy, geometry, and calligraphy together. On my Creative Portal you will discover photos of crystals, 
                ice, clouds, vinyl and other artwork too. 
        <br><br>
                I am a creative pioneer of geometric and photographic art. My background is in the sciences, arts and music. Since I was a young child I became entranced by nature and 
                also our scientific quest to understand natural phenomena. My fascination is with the very small, the very large, and the invisible. I sense the information between the 
                gaps between the gaps and in the silence of a sound that fades into emptiness. 
        <br><br>
                In these galleries you will find a small sample of my many pieces of creative pictures and artwork. Pictures included span over 20 years of artwork. 
                For my photography I use a Fuji SX-10 mirrorless camera, a Huawei P30 pro smartphone and a Nikon D5100 digital SLR. I also write blogs and maintain the 
                content on the website <a href="https://www.lightcodes.com/" target="_blank">Light Codes</a>.

                    <h2 class = "justify">My name is Tim Stokes and I was born in Cardiff and grew up in Barry in South Wales. Now I live in Manchester where I enjoy keeping up to date with science and technology, watching science fiction, 
                    psychedelic trance and most forms of alternative music, and spiritual healing and meditation.  
                <br><br>    
                    My vision is to ignite our lights and awaken humanity across the world through a powerful combination of art, photography, technology, and 
                    spirituality. To be touched, moved, and inspired by this vision so that the hearts and minds of humanity awaken to a deeper reality beyond that experienced by our senses.</h2>

                    <h2 class = "justify">I completed a degree in astronomy at UCL and then studied computer graphics to postgraduate level. I have worked in many sectors and roles including academic research, systems development and virtual reality,

                <br><br>
                I am exploring a career change back into software development. I would love to work in a scientific, technical or educational organisation. In the past I have worked in a variety of teams and job roles in office administration, 
                marketing, design, and customer service.

                <div class = text> <h1 class = center>My Coding Experience</h1>
            <br>
            <h2 class = "justify">When I was at school I learned Basic on BBC Micro computers. Then at university as part of my Astronomy degree I learned Fortran-77. During my postgraduate studies I learned C and C++ with OpenGL and UNIX scripting. 
            I also created artifical life simulations and wrote a couple of websites in HTML in the mid 1990's. Then I researched physics modelling and simulation for virtual reality before working as a System Developer at Ordnance Survey. 
            <br><br>
            I have just completed the hands-on Develop course with Code Nation where I learned the basics of Python in the Visual Studio environment. Then we deepened our learning through developing a text-based adventure game. We worked in teams and used Trello and Slack as communication 
            and project management tools. I felt the buzz of programming and the endorphins rise when solving problems and applying solutions in the coding environment. During this time I have also been actively researching computer technology in the areas of games, VR, AI, data science, simulation, hacking and crytocurrency. 
            <br><br>
            After Python we learned HTML, CSS, and Flexbox for creating a short website in the Visual Studio environment. After many challenges with editing flexboxes and formatting text I am finally finding my rhythm. The trick is patience and also to observe others. Then apply what I learnt to my site and test it 
            rather than starting from scratch. This is the result of that work, now hosted on Github. I have uploaded this site on Friday 12th November.</h2>

                <div class = text> <h1 class = center>Project Leadership</h1>
            <br>
            <h2 class = "justify">During my life I have worked on and managed many projects. I have organised and ran art exhibitions at galleries several times and also at music events. In the spring of this year I completed an online course in Managing 
            Creative Projects with the Factory Academy in Manchester. I learned all the steps to creating a project initiation document and researched the logistics of my project to have an online exhibition of my work. This website is the fruit of this project.
            <br><br>   
            During the last three years I have completed several courses with the Landmark Forum. The Forum is an intensive weekend with long hours exploring deeply who we are, how we behave, and becoming people of 100% integrity. Since then I have completed their
            Introduction Leaders Programme. That was nearly a year of classrooms and life coaching with four long weekends. I assisted with their courses and authentically shared my experienced of the Forum, touching, moving and inspiring them in their lifes.
            <br><br>
            Now I stand at a crossroads. A few years ago, I looked at spiritual energy healing and completed Facilitator Training with Star Magic Energy healing. Rather than doing 1:1 healing, I have a passion for running talks and courses about spirituality, science, technology, 
            and culture. With that aim in mind I  joined an entrepreneur network called GeniusU where groups of like-minded people can collaberate together as educators, entrepreneurs, and cryptocurrency investors.
